</ul>

<h1>INSTALLATION</h1>
You need to have <a href=https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases>BepInEx</a> installed in your ULTRAKILL directory to use this mod, and here's how to do it:
<ul>
    <li>Download the BepInEx x64 <code>.zip</code> file to your ULTRAKILL folder, though for Linux, you would need to set up BepInEx with Proton or Wine. https://docs.bepinex.dev/articles/advanced/steam_interop.html#protonwine
        <br>To get to your ULTRAKILL folder:
        <ul>
            <li>Open the ULTRAKILL tab in your Steam library.</li>
            <li>Click on the Settings icon, or right click on the ULTRAKILL tab, and click Manage > Browse local files.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Run the game once so BepInEx can generate config files and other stuff.</li>
    <li>Download the ULTRAHUD zip from the <a href="https://github.com/Captain-Ravioli/ULTRAHUD/releases">Releases</a> tab, into the BepInEx\plugins folder in your ULTRAKILL directory.</li>
</ul>
And that's it! You now have the ULTRAHUD mod!<br>
<h1>SHARING HUDS</h1>
ULTRAHUD stores HUDs as images that you can send to other people, they are located in the ULTRAHUD\HUDs folder in your plugins directory.
<h1>IMPORTANT NOTES</h1>
<ul>
    <li>If you have ULTRAHUD, you have to use it as your "COLORS" settings replacement. It's better anyway, unless you need to change enemy outlines.</li>
    <li>It's better to delete HUDs from the ULTRAHUD menu instead of directly in your file explorer.</li>
    <li>You can change the <code>dreamed.jpg</code> file to anything you want, as long as it's 635x98 pixels in size.</li>
</ul>
